  <h2>My Weapons</h2>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use YouTube, TikTok, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram almost every day, especially when I feel bored at home or tired from school works. These apps help me relax and forget stress, sadness, or negative energy that im feeling sometimes. I also use them to communicate with my friends and loved ones, even if they are far from me. Through social media, I was able to know different people like content creators and comedy vloggers who make me laugh and feel inspired. Apart from entertainment, these apps keep me updated about news, trends, and what is happening in the real world.Google Maps is one app I really cannot leave without whenever I go outside especially out of town or far away from my home. I use it when I travel, hang out with my friends, or go out with my family. It is very helpful, especially when I am driving alone or going to a place that I am not familiar. Because of Google Maps, I feel more comfortable and confident going to different destinations without getting lost.
   Google is also one of the most important tools for me when it comes to knowledge and academics.
    I use it for searching information, answering assignments, and understanding lessons that are difficult for me.
    Whenever I have questions that I do not know the answer, Google is the first thing I open. It helps me learn faster and makes my school life easier as an IT student.
